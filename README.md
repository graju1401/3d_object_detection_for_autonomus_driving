# 3d_object_detection_for_autonomus_driving

This thesis focus on implementing robust persistive system for object detection for autonomus driving in urban scenario.
Object detection is a challenging problem for a system to detect object and take appropriate actions in unpredicted environments
like raining, Dark light.... I proposed a novel architecture that takes takes input data from LiDAR and camera sensors to extract 
features using Capsule Network, These features are shared by two sub networks Region Proposal Networks and Object Detector to get 
the class probabilities of the objects and 3D bounding boxes simultaneously.
